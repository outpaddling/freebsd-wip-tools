.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The
.B wip-update
script downloads and installs frameworks for development versions of various
FreeBSD ports.  These are frameworks for ports that have not been committed
to the official ports tree.

The software installed via the ports is not affected by wip-update
in any way: Only the frameworks are updated.  To upgrade software
installed via these ports:

1. Remove the software via the ports system (e.g. "make deinstall" or
pkg_delete)

2. Run wip-update

3. Reinstall the port using "make install" or "port install".
